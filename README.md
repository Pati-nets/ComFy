# anaLOG: The friendly log and model analyzer #
This project accompanies the paper *Important Factors: Complexity Dimensions for Petri Nets*.
With this tool, you can reproduce the results of the paper or perform factor analyses for the complexity of Petri nets on your own data.


## Installation ##
1. Ensure that you have *Python 3.12* or later installed.
2. Clone the project to your local files.
3. Go to (https://zenodo.org/records/13853660), download and install *ProM4Py* on your system wherever you like.
4. Copy the contents of the folder `ProM4Py-Python-Library/prom4py` into the `./prom4py` folder of the ComFy-tool, but keep the files `discovery.py` and `__init__.py` provided by ComFy, as these files enable ProM4Py to call more discovery algorithms than just the Inductive Miner.
5. Replace the string for the variable `prom4py_script_path` in the file `Constants.py` by the path where you installed ProM4Py and where the file `ProM4Py.sh` or `ProM4Py.bat` is located. Choose the path to `ProM4Py.bat` if you work on a Windows system, or `Prom4Py.sh` if you work on a Unix-based system.
6. Install the requirements listed in *requirements.txt*, for example by opening a terminal and executing:
```
python3.12 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
7. Run the program by executing
```
python3.12 main.py
```

### Trouble-Shooting ###
- If you get the following error, you did not copy the contents of the folder `ProM4Py-Python-Library/prom4py` into the `./prom4py` folder of the ComFy-tool.
![Error message if the ProM4Py library was not copied](./images/comfy-prom4py-library-not-copied.png)

- If you get the following error, you forgot to replace the string `'path-to-prom4py/Prom4Py.sh'` by the path where the `.sh` or `.bat` file are located.
![Error message if no correct path to ProM4Py was specified](./images/comfy-prom4py-path-not-set.png)


## Usage ##
Ensure that the `xes`-files you want to analyze are in the folder `input-folder`.
For example, you can use the trainings logs from the process discovery contest 2025, found at (https://doi.org/10.4121/7212a73a-1eac-4a08-8c01-973dca020822)
Then, run the program by executing the following command:
```
python3.12 main.py
```
If the installation was successful, you will be greeted by the following sight:
![A screenshot showing the start of the program, where the user can select the measures they want to analyze](./images/comfy-measure-selection.png)
You can use the arrow keys to navigate through the complexity measures and hit the space bar to select the ones you wish to analyze.
Alternatively, you can hit the key 'a' to select all measures and use the space bar to deselect those you do not wish to analyze.
We recommend not choosing the measures cross-connectivity, depth, diameter or cyclicity for your first run, since they take a lot of time to calculate.
As soon as you are happy with your selection, you can hit Enter to go to the next step.
![A screenshot showing the selection of the discovery algorithms for the analysis](./images/comfy-miner-selection.png)
In this selection, you can choose one or more discovery algorithms to automatically discover Petri nets for the event log in the input folder.
ComFy uses the ProM4Py library to perform the discovery, which takes a short moment to initialize.
![A screenshot showing the initialization message of ProM4Py](./images/comfy-prom4py-initialization.png)
After initialization, ProM4Py is issued to discover the Petri nets.
Depending on the number of `xes`-files in your input folder, this may take a while.

After the discovery phase, ComFy will automatically perform Bartlett's test of sphericity, described at (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartlett's_test).
Furthermore, the program will compute all MSA values to perform the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin test, described at (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin_test).
![A screenshot showing the execution of Bartlett's test of sphericity and the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin test](./images/comfy-btos-and-msa-test.png)
In case Bartlett's test of sphericity fails, the user will be prompted to decide whether to continue the analysis.
If the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin test fails, because some MSA values are lower than specified by the variable `msa_threshold` in the file `Constants.py`, ComFy removes the variables with insufficient MSA values and recalculates the MSA values for the remaining variables.
![A screenshot showing how the program repeats the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin test](./images/comfy-repeated-msa-test.png)
If the MSA test fails because the overall MSA value is too low, the program will exit, since a factor analysis would not be statistically relevant on the provided data.
If the tests succeeded, however, ComFy proposes to show a Scree plot to decide on the number of factors, as described in (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scree_plot).
![A screenshot showing how the program shows the Scree plot](./images/comfy-scree-test.png)
Of course, the user can also decide not to show this plot if they already know the number of factors influencing the complexity scores in their analysis.
After they chose the number of factors, the user can choose the rotation that should be used on the factor loadings during the factor analysis.
![A screenshot showing the selectable rotations for the factor analysis](./images/comfy-rotation-selection.png)
Afterward, ComFy will perform the factor analysis with the specified parameters.
If desired, the program directly shows the factor loadings, descriptive statistics and the communalities by using `matplotlib`.
![A screenshot showing the factor loadings and the descriptive statistics of the exemplary factor analysis](./images/comfy-factor-loadings.png)
Regardless of the user's choice, ComFy will store the results of the factor analysis and the results of all previous tests in a LaTeX file in the folder `output`.
Furthermore, it stores the raw complexity data in a `csv`-file for later reference or further investigations.
![A screenshot showing files in the output folder that result from the executed factor analysis](./images/comfy-output-report.png)
To see the LaTeX files stored during the analysis of the paper *Important Factors: Complexity Dimensions for Petri Nets*, the user may navigate to the folder `paper-results` inside the folder `output`.
On some systems, ProM4Py ends the execution by deleting local files. 
Depending on the sample size and the number of executed discovery algorithms, this might take a while.
However, killing the process during this phase does not pose any problems.
